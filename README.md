# Spotify-Console
A Spotify player for Linux terminals.

## Building
In `src/`, run `make`. The binary file `spotifyConsole.exe` will be output.

## Running
The client secret for a Spotify Developer app must be put in a file called `src/CLIENT_SECRET`. Currently, only the client secret for my app will work, as the client ID is hardcoded. This will be changed in the future.
